If you are looking for a ready-to-run library for use in Processing or Java,
download it by visiting this repository's releases page:

https://github.com/todbot/blink1-java/releases

To try out the library via the command-line, see `blink1-tool-java.sh`.

To build the library, see the Makefile.
On most platforms you should be able to do `make jar`.
